5/20 Notes
Recursion Notes


Different ways of going through a tree:
Pre-Order traversal, overall idea is top left right
In-Order traversal, left, center, right, useful for searching for a range of numbers and not one number
Post-Order traversal, left, right, center, good for deleting trees

template<typename T>
bool is_binary_search_tree(const TreeNode<T> *root) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return false; //input check
    }

    bool left = false
    //check if the left is also a bst
    if (!is_binary_search_tree(root->left)) {
        return false;
    }
    //check if the right tree is a bst
    //check if top is between left and right
    return  is_binary_search_tree(root->right) &&
            is_binary_search_tree(root->left)&&
            (root->value >= root->left->value || root->left == nullptr) &&
            (root->value <= root->right->value || root->right == nullptr);
}

Make sure to study tree traversals, and confirming whether trees are binary search trees

You dont always have to store a tree with nodes, you can also use an array


5/27 Notes

Know the sorts, you should be able to recognize them, know if something changed, be able to write, know what they do.

BIG O

Store: whats the best way to store things to that we can search things faster

ADT Hashtable:
-Think of asking an employee at the store where a certain item is
-This is the easiest one and most commonly used
-Also referred to as "Dictionary", "Set", "Map"
-O(1) instant search and insert/deletion
-Even though instant performance is promised, it is now always gauranteed, in the worse case, its not better than a linear search
-ESSENTIALLY USED TO FIND STUFF REALLY QUICKLY

-In real life, you would be selecting what appropriate data structure can help to solve your problem
*NOTE Everything in a set is unique
-The conversion from a key to an index is called a hash function
-Collision, happens when 2 keys are mapped to the same spot ON EXAM
-Chaining, when different data is mapped to the same spot ON EXAM

-ON HW 3, read and understand the get function

Efficiency/Big O
- least amount if inputs/resources to achieve the highest amount of output
- Whenever you see the word "complexity", replace it with the word efficiency
-ON EXAM, the motorcycle has less power but has less weight, so the output ratio is better for the motorcycle compared to the rest
-Efficicency depends on the amount of elements, for example, quick sort and bubble sort, the difference comes with the amount of elements

5/29
Animal Crossing Problem ON THE EXAM, same principle but would be related to computers (4 codes to run with 1 cpu, goal is to minimize the runtime)
-You will be given a specific time and asked if it is possible for all to make it
-Neither should walk alone with the light
-Longest should walk together to minimize longest time
-It usually IS possible, you want somebody with shorter walking time to walk it back
-If still confused, look up the bridge riddle on youtube

Big O
Calculation of Big O (like on the bubble sort slides)
-Bubble sort and insertion sort complexity is the same, need to know which sort to use PROBABLY ON EXAM
-When dealing with array, bubble sort is preferred
-When dealing with a linked list, either is good
-Essentially, Big O tells you something, but it is not everything

LRU

6/3

Remember the Big0 chart

The box weight problem is basiaclly a binary search, with a big 0 of logn

Code from demo will likely be ON THE FINAL

Truth tables will be on the exam, (deciphering !, && and ||)

Propositional: A statement that is either true or false

"It is sunny today" the statement is either right or wrong

Propositional Logic: Implication
"when p, then q"

-if p doesnt happen, that dosent necesarilly mean q wont happen
-if p does happen, q will happen
-the reverse is not always true "if q, then p"
Propositional Logic:
